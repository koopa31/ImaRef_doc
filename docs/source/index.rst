Welcome to Napari Stereotyping's documentation!
===================================

**Napari Stereotyping** is a Napari plugin dedicated to stereotyping the olfactory system of zebrafish
embryos imaged in 3D, by creating a reproducible orthonormal reference frame. The method is based on the generation of
a cone containing the orthonormal reference frame, through the manual placement of well-defined points into the embryo.

The aim of the project is to rapidly create a reference frame in differentgit c embryos to make analyses comparable.

Check out the :doc:`usage` section for further information, including
how to :doc:`installation` the project.
