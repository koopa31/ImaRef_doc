Welcome to Napari Stereotyping's documentation!
===================================

**Napari Stereotyping** is a Napari plugin dedicated to stereotyping the olfactory system of zebrafish
embryos imaged in 3D, by creating a reproducible orthonormal reference frame. The method relies on ellipsoid fitting through the manual placement of well-defined points within the embryo. The center and axes of the ellipsoid define an orthonormal reference frame.

The aim of the project is to rapidly create a reference frame in different embryos to get rid of the orientation
differences during acquisition and make analyses (tracking, counting, orientation characterization) comparable.

Check out the :doc:`usage` section for further information, including
how to :doc:`install <installation>` the project.

   This project is under active development and funded by Julie Batut's team at the Centre for Integrative biology in Toulouse.
